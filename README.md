# M606AMachineLearning
Classwork and practice

# Description

Machine learning is recognized as one of the most interesting and exciting fields that impact our
lives every day. In this module, students will learn core machine learning concepts, including
supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Furthermore, students will learn to design and
implement machine learning systems in practice.

# Objectives

Specific objectives include
 To evaluate core concepts of machine learning.
 To build machine learning systems in action.

# Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the module, students will be able to
1. Critically evaluate the business contexts that can benefit from machine learning.
2. Critically analyze core machine learning concepts, including supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
3. Critically build machine learning systems for various problems using Scikit-Learn.

# Teaching Methods

Students will engage in learning through a series of directed study activities, lectures, and
self-study. The teaching sessions will be divided into two parts. The first part belongs to an
interactive lecture, where students learn about theoretical aspects of the presented topic. The
second part will be an interactive lab, where students will implement the presented concepts
themselves under the guidance of the tutor. Students will be also directed to online materials
for further study.
